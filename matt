         <h2>Thinking of getting a cat?</h2>
          
          <p>Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn’t want too much human interaction. What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if you want it to.</p>
          <p>All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of experiences), which can make it fearful or confident with people and life in general. The environment in which you keep a cat is also extremely significant – for example if it lives with many other cats which do not get on, then it will be stressed and will react differently than if it was on its own. While there is no guaranteed way to choose the perfect cat for you and your lifestyle, understanding your expectations as well as what makes cats tick will help you to bring home a cat that should be able to cope with its new environment and be the pet that you want too.</p>

         <h2>To care for a cat you will need to:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide plenty of human companionship</li>
              <li>Provide regular, suitable meals with a constant supply of fresh water</li>
              <li>Provide a clean and comfortable bed</li>
              <li>Provide the cat with outdoor access or be prepared to empty and clean a litter tray on a daily basis</li>
              <li>Provide it with a stimulating and safe environment</li>
              <li>Groom it regularly. Longhaired cats require daily grooming</li>
              <li>Have it neutered between 4 and 6 months old</li>
              <li>Vaccinate against the major feline diseases regularly</li>
              <li>Take the cat to the vet when it shows any sign of illness</li>
              <li>Insure your cat or make sure you can afford the cost of any veterinary treatment it may need</li>

        <h2>How much care and attention does a cat need?</h2>
          <p>As pets go, cats are relatively low maintenance compared to dogs which need companionship, walking, training etc. However, like any pet, they do need care, and some cats need more care than others. Do you want to spend a lot of time with your cat, do you want it to be demanding, or do you have limited time? Cats can fit into busy, modern lifestyles more easily than dogs, as they are pretty independent, can be left alone much more easily and are more suitable for smaller flats or houses. Cats are often chosen by people who have busy and stressful lifestyles and who want some companionship when they go home to relax.</p>

          <h2> Good and Bad Foods </h2>
            <h3> Good Foods </h3>
               <p>Cats are meat eaters, plain and simple. They have to have protein from meat for a strong heart, good vision, and a healthy reproductive system. Cooked beef, chicken, turkey, and small amounts of lean deli meats are a great way to give them that.</p> 
               <p>Good and healthy dry catfood is also a good option!</p>

               <figure>
                   <img src="images/healthycatfood.png" alt="Picture of healthy catfood">
                 <figcaption>These are good examples of healthy catfood</figcaption>

        <section>
           <h3> Bad Foods </h3>
             <p>Some of the most toxic food for cats include onions and garlic, raw eggs and meat, chocolate, alcohol, grapes and raisins. </p>
             <p>Avoid feeding your cat table scraps, especially around the holidays, as these may contain potentially toxic ingredients </p>
           
           <figure>
              <img src="images/toxiccatfoods.png" alt="Picture of unhealthy catfood">
             <figcaption> Here are some examples of what NOT to feed a cat </figcaption>
           </figure>
          
             <h4>Onions and Garlic</h4>
               <p>Onions, garlic, shallots, and scallions can cause damage to your cat’s red blood cells and lead to anemia. These foods are typically poisonous when eaten in large quantities, but exposure to concentrated forms of onion or garlic, such as onion soup mix or garlic powder, can also be toxic. Cats with symptoms of lethargy, weakness, reduced appetite, pale gums, and orange to dark red urine should be taken to the vet immediately.</p>
             <h4>Raw eggs, raw meat and bones</h4>
               <p>Just like humans, consumption of raw eggs or raw meat can lead to salmonella or E. coli poisoning in cats. Symptoms of the illness vary but can include vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. Salmonella and E. coli can also be transmitted to humans, so be careful to properly wash your hands after cooking and keep your cat away from these raw foods. Raw eggs also contain an enzyme that can lead to skin and coat problems. Keep your cat from eating raw bones as well—she could choke on them, injure her digestive tract, or damage her teeth.</p>
             <h4>Chocolate and Caffeinated Drinks</h4>
               <p>We’ve all heard that chocolate can be fatal to dogs, but it’s just as poisonous for cats as well. Chocolate contains substances called methylxanthines, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea, high body temperature, muscle tremors, abnormal heart rhythm, abdominal discomfort, increased thirst, and seizures. Methylxanthines are also found in caffeinated beverages and should be avoided. See your vet if your cat experiences any of these symptoms. As a general rule of thumb, darker chocolates are more dangerous than milk and white chocolate.</p>
             <h4>Alcohol and Raw Dough</h4>
               <p>Alcoholic beverages and foods that contain alcohol can be dangerous for your cat. Ingestion can cause vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, disorientation, trouble breathing, coma, and even death. It’s also important to keep your cat away from raw dough. Raw dough causes expansion in the stomach, or creates alcohol in the stomach. If you think your cat has ingested even a small amount of alcohol, take her to the vet immediately.</p>
             <h4>Milk and Dairy Products</h4>
               <p>Even though your cat may enjoy drinking milk, it isn’t necessarily good for her. Cats have trouble digesting the lactose in milk, which can cause an upset stomach or diarrhea. Most cats are only exposed to lactose from their mother's milk when they are kittens. Because kittens only drink from their mother’s milk for a few weeks, their digestive systems are often not equipped to handle a reintroduction to lactose. So, while some cats have no trouble tolerating milk, they are not recommended to drink anything but their mother’s milk while kittens, due to the possibility of digestive issues.</p>
             <h4>Grapes and Raisins</h4>
               <p>Even <strong>a small</strong> amount of grapes and raisins can cause your cat to become ill — they can even lead to rapid development of kidney failure. Within 12 hours of ingestion, vomiting sometimes occurs. Other signs that can show up within 24 hours include lethargy, diarrhea, reduced appetite, abdominal pain, decreased urination and abdominal pain.</p>
               <p>Although it isn't clear why, grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure in cats, and even a small amount can make a cat ill. Repeated vomiting and hyperactivity are early signs. Although some cats show no ill effects, it's best not to give your cat any grapes and to keep grapes and raisins off countertops and other places accessible to your cat.</p>
             <h4>Dog Food</h4>
               <p>Though dog food is not toxic to cats, your cat needs a very different set of nutrients than a dog. Cat food should contain plenty of vitamin A, taurine, arachidonic acid and protein, and dog food has much lower levels of these nutrients. Dogs can survive with lower levels of vitamin A and protein, while cats cannot. Dogs are also able to produce taurine and arachidonic acid, but cats must have these acids in their food. Without a sufficient amount of taurine, cats can develop heart disease, vision and dental issues.</p>

          <h2>Preventing Cats from Eating Dangerous Foods</h2>
           <ul>
             <li>Store foods out of your cat’s reach. Installing cat-proof locks on cabinets may be necessary for a curious kitty.</li>
             <li>Do not let your cat on the counter while you’re cooking or eating.</li>
             <li>Do not feed them table scraps.</li>
             <li>It is <strong>especially important</strong> to be more mindful during the holidays. There is likely more enticing people food around, much of which can upset your cat’s tummy or even harm her.</li>

        <h2>What are cats?</h2>
        <p class="whatarecats"> The cat (<em>Felis catus</em>) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

         <h2>Characteristics</h2>
          <h3>Size</h3>
             <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat. It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb)</p>

              <img src="images/mycat9.jpeg" alt="Picture of a tabby cat laying upside down funny">
           
          <h3>Claws</h3>
             <p>Cats have protractible and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits ("polydactyly"). Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and in Great Britain.</p>
              <img src="images/cat-shows-claws.jpg" alt="Cat shows claws">
           
          <h3>Balance</h3>
            <p>Most breeds of cat are notably fond of sitting in high places, or perching. A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.</p>

            </video>  
           
          <h3>Behavior</h3>
           <p>Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night. Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres). The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active in the morning and evening. However, house cats' behaviour is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent. Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.</p>

         <h2 id="persiancat">Persian cats</h2>
          <p>The Persian cat is a long-haired breed with a distinctive flat face and large eyes. This breed gets their name from Persia — now, modern Iran — where they most likely originated. Because they're an ancient breed that dates back to 1684 BC, their history isn’t certain. Over time, the Persian cat has become a great family pet due to their sweet, friendly, and patient nature.</p>
           <img src="images/persiancat.jpg" alt="Persian cat">

          <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
            <p>Persian cats are a medium-sized breed, but they appear larger than they are due to their large amount of fur. The Persian cat size depends on its gender, with males being larger than females. Both males and females have a broad, short appearance. You can easily identify Persian cats by their large eyes, round face, and short muzzle. Some describe their face as “pansy-like”. Persian cat characteristics include long, soft fur. Their coats come in almost all colors and patterns. This includes solid colors, parti-colors, and tortoiseshell coats. They also have a wide range of eye colors that usually depend on the color of their coat. For example, blue eyes usually accompany Himalayan coats</p>

         <h2 id="sphynxcat">Sphynx cats</h2>
          <p>The Sphynx cat (pronounced SFINGKS) also known as the Canadian Sphynx, is a breed of cat known for its lack of fur. Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation, and the Sphynx was developed through selective breeding of these animals, starting in the 1960s.</p>

          <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
           <p>According to breed standards, the skin should have the texture of chamois leather, as it has fine hairs, or the cat may be completely hairless. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. The cats have a narrow, long head and webbed feet. Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. Because they have no fur, Sphynx cats lose body heat more readily than coated cats, making them both warm to the touch and prone to seeking out warm places.</p>

         <h2 id="tabbycat">Tabby cats</h2>
          <p>A tabby cat, or simply tabby, is any domestic cat (Felis catus) with a distinctive 'M'-shaped marking on its forehead; stripes by its eyes and across its cheeks, along its back, and around its legs and tail; and (differing by tabby type), characteristic striped, dotted, lined, flecked, banded, or swirled patterns on the body—neck, shoulders, sides, flanks, chest, and abdomen. "Tabby" is not a breed of cat, but a coat type seen in almost all genetic lines of domestic cats, regardless of breed.</p>

          <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
          <p>The tabby pattern is found in many official cat breeds and is a hallmark of the landrace extremely common among the general population of cats around the world. The tabby pattern occurs naturally and is connected both to the coat of the domestic cat's direct ancestor and to those of their close relatives: the African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica), the European wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the Asiatic wildcat (Felis lybica ornata), all of which have similar coats, both by pattern and coloration. One genetic study of domestic cats found at least five founders.</p>
